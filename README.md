A social recipe experience

# TheVeganAmongUs (VAU)
## A Social Recipe website

VAU is a social recipe site, and this is the source for it.  It will have the following basic features upon completion:

* Collection of recipes from users (CRUD with print/export)
* Meal planning (create meal plans/menus, print menus)
* Social Network integration (add recipes to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest)
* Shopping list creation
* User specific profiles
* Nutritional Information
* Sub-categorize recipes into cuisines


There will be also a way to categorize the recipe such as (but not limited to):

* Breakfast
* Lunch
* Supper
* Tea
* Snack
* Soup
* Appetizer
* Desert
* etc.

As time goes on, there will likely be more added to this - and maybe some removed.  We'll be building this in an agile fashion, so it will be prioritized, reworked, and running with iterative builds.  For the short term - I'll be deploying to the free Heroku site, but as it nears a 'prod-like' state, it will be put on recipes.theveganamongus.com (in the same hosting service as www.theveganamongus.com)
